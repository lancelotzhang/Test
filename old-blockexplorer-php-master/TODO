Liraz's TODO list
=================

- refactor blockudpate.php (eliminate code duplication for mainnet and
  testnet blockupdate)

- update rewritten blockupdate.php to use stock bitcoind 0.8. 

  The current version only works with a specially patched version of
  bitcoind 0.7.

- redesign database schema to reduce diskspace usage. It currently uses
  10X the disk space that bitcoind uses. Mostly because it stores raw
  bitcoin data inefficiently over and over again.

- new web design

  - how many transaction confirmations

- add interesting visualizations

- rewrite in node.js

- explore hacking bitcoind so that we don't have to keep another copy of
  the blockchain in the database.

Michael's (AKA Theymos) todo list
=================================

Here was my to-do list for BBE:

- keys should have a foreign key relationship with the transactions they first appeared in. Otherwise reorgs can break addressfirstseen.
- improve sends with multiple inputs from the same address -- 1MgD6rah5zUgEGYZnNmdpnXMaDR3itKYzU
- show total work for blocks
- is totalvalue being counted for duplicate txns? Probably shouldn't be.
- clicking an address on /address/ pages should highlight the transaction on the new address's side
- sends to self give wrong balance temporarily in running balance. txns should be combined w/ rowspan
- address query no longer needs to look at transactions table?
- fix transaction caching
- show sequence numbers on HTML pages
- make rss more visible
- nethash averages are wrong
- elapsed time for blocks
- list (xxxx total) after addresses on block pages?
- make rss more visible
- firstbits on address pages
- better shortlinks
- deal with dup coinbase "double spends"
- charts - address/tx
- rss/email notifications for address
- rumored/verified address owners
